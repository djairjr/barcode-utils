# This D-Bus service activation file is only for systemd support since
# an auto-activated BarcodeManager would be quite surprising for those people
# who have BM installed but turned off.  Thus the Exec path available to
# D-Bus is /bin/false, but systemd knows the real Exec path due to the BM
# systemd .service file.
