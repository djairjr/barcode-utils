BarcodeManager consists of two parts: one is on the system level daemon that
manages the connections to the barcode scanners and gathers information about
newly attached barcode scanner hardware. The other is a systray applet that
users can use to interact with the BarcodeManager daemon. 

After modifying /etc/BarcodeManager/bm-systems-settings.conf
you may want to restart the system-settings daemon using the command:
"sudo killall bm-system-settings" to apply those changes.
